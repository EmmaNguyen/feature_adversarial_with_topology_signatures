#### About
This is a search on Deep Generative Models with Feature Adversarial Learning to learn topological signatures on 2-fold manifold.

### Requirements

Please use `Anaconda` to set up a virtual environment for main Python 3.6 packages. If you have not known what is `Anaconda`, please go to the following [link](!https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) for more information. Then type this in a terminal,
```conda env create -n environment.yml
```
Note: Here is `environment` is a name I put into for repository. There will be some others installation for third-party packages, I will put instruction later. However, I would recommend to quickly move forward to GUDHI. So this repository is only for temporary use.

### How to run source ```
python main.py
```
